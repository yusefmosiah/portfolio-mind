# Contributing

## Voice & Style
- Declarative, vivid, sparse—no fluff.
- Define primitives once; reference afterward.
- Use short sidebars for examples, not long anecdotes.

## Citations
Tag every reference with one of:
- **[Established]** peer-reviewed or official documentation
- **[Emerging]** preprints / active debate
- **[Speculative]** author theory / conjecture

## Figures
- Keep SVG/PNG under `figures/`. Source files (draw.io / mermaid / pptx) go in `figures/source/`.
- Export heavy renders to `figures/rendered/` (ignored by git).

## Predictions Boxes
Every chapter ends with 3–5 falsifiable predictions.

## PR Process
- Branch off `main`: `feature/chapter-name`
- Small PRs (<500 lines) with a clear summary.
