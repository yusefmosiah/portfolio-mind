# Book Proposal — The Portfolio Mind: Intelligence, Power, and the Economics of Abundance

**Author:** YM Nathanson  
**Length (target):** 85,000–110,000 words  
**Audience:** Tech executives, policy folks, founders, researchers, curious general readers

## Hook
Intelligence isn’t the absence of bias; it’s the orchestration of many biases over time. This lens cleanly explains today’s AI brittleness, media dysfunction, and political economy—and points to designs that actually adapt.

## Why now
Voice-LLMs, open models, and collapsing AI costs are forcing a shift from “bigger models” to “better minds.” This book names the pattern and gives builders a playbook.
