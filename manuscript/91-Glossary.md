# Glossary (Primitives)

- **Expectation-patterns:** Reusable heuristics (biases/mental models) that forecast tokens/world-states.
- **Constructive/Destructive interference:** Alignment/clash among concurrent expectation-patterns.
- **Certainty trajectory:** Confidence over time; ∂confidence/∂t signals meta-cognitive adjustments.
- **Architectural amnesia:** Loss of temporal cognitive info across steps (no access to own trajectories).
- **UFR / FER:** Unified Factored Representation vs Fractured Entangled Representation.
- **Persona vector:** High-dimensional behavioral orientation learned via fine-tuning.
